## About

MCStatus is a Discord Bot used by over 50,000 unique users that allows you to check the status of your favourite Minecraft related services.

Without having to leave Discord, you can now easily check the status of the official Mojang servers to see if that's the reason you can't log onto your favourite server. As well as that, you can always see how many people are online on a server with more stats too.
